# Holberton School Curriculum: 0x01. Implement a design with bootstrap

## Project

This Project is for Holberton School Web Frontend Courses. I will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. This is to use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that I have learned previously.

### Requirements

* You have to use Bootstrap
* Your **styles.css** must be as small as you can - you must use as much as you can Bootstrap classes


### Interactions note:

* Web pages must switch to the tablet version when the screen width is 768px
* Web pages must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 576px
* button hover/active: **opacity: 0.9**
